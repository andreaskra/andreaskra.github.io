A lot of talk is heard these days about artificial intelligence and how it's dangerous, inevitable and yet might be humanitie's greates (and last) invention. I don't disagree, but in this post I'd like to shed a light on some aspects of this revolution we're undergoing that have not gotten much attention overall. Some of them being what superintelligence actually means, how it might manifest itself aside from classical AI-scenarios, why human extiction shouldn't be our no. one concern, how the AIs of today work in their inner core and how that might develop going forward.
