Epilogue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of talk is heard these days about artificial intelligence and how it's dangerous, inevitable and yet might be humanitie's greates (and last) invention. I don't disagree, but in this post I'd like to shed a light on some aspects of this revolution we're undergoing that have not gotten much attention overall. Some of them being what superintelligence actually means, how it might happen aside from classic AI, why human extiction shouldn't be our no. one concern, how the AIs of today work in their inner core and how that might develop going forward.

I am by no means an absolute expert in the field of AI, but I have a professional background in computer science and engineering and I'll back up all my claims with sources or explain my reasoning whenever necessary. This article is intended to be simple to digest and not require any special knowledge, all you'll need is some curiosity and time - or at least a desire to procrastinate.
